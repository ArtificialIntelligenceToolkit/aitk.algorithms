    A genetic algorithm is a model of biological evolution.  It
    maintains a population of chromosomes.  Each chromosome is
    represented as a list.  A fitness function must be
    defined to score each chromosome.  Initially, a random population
    is created. Then a series of generations are executed.  Each
    generation, parents are selected from the population based on
    their fitness.  More highly fit chromosomes are more likely to be
    selected to create children.  With some probability crossover will
    be done to model sexual reproduction.  With some very small
    probability mutations will occur.  A generation is complete once
    all of the original parents have been replaced by children.  This
    process continues until the maximum generation is reached or when
    the isDone method returns True.
